# Banking System in Python

This project is a simple **Banking System** developed in Python, intended to simulate basic banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. 

## Features

- **Create Account**: Open a new account by entering basic customer details.
- **Deposit Funds**: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Allows users to withdraw money, with checks for sufficient balance.
- **Check Balance**: Retrieve the current account balance.
- **Transaction History**: View recent transactions for an account.

## Goals

- Build Core Banking Functionality

Implement fundamental banking features, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and account management. These features should be designed to simulate a basic, real-world banking environment.

- Create a User-Friendly Console Interface

Develop an intuitive console interface where users can interact with the banking system. The interface should guide users through options and provide meaningful feedback for successful or failed transactions.

- Enable Persistent Data Storage

Integrate a simple database (JSON file) to store customer and account data. This will allow the system to save data between sessions, emulating a real bank where customer information and transaction history are stored securely.

- Implement Transaction Tracking

Track deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks for each account, allowing users to view recent transactions. This feature adds transparency and simulates account statements, which are common in banking applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: Programming language used for the banking logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Structure for managing accounts and customer data.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. **Visual Studio**:
   - Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
   - During installation, select the **Python development workload**.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open Visual Studio and go to **File > Clone Repository**.
   - Enter the repository URL:
     ```bash
     https://github.com/your-username/banking-system.git
     ```

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio**
   - Once cloned, go to **File > Open > Project/Solution**.
   - Select the `banking-system` folder, and open the `main.py` file.
     

4. **Run the Application**
   - In **Solution Explorer**, right-click `main.py` and select **Start with Debugging** or **Start Without Debugging**.
   - This will open the console and start the banking application.

## Usage

1. **Creating an Account**
   - Follow prompts to enter details and create a new bank account.

2. **Depositing and Withdrawing Money**
   - Use the provided options to deposit or withdraw funds from your account.

3. **Checking Balance**
   - Choose this option to display your account's current balance.

4. **Viewing Transaction History**
   - Check recent deposits, withdrawals, and other transactions (if implemented).
